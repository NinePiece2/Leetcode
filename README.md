## Description

This is a repo to store my leetcode solutions but I went a bit Schizo with it and it pulls the leetcode solutions, creates READMEs with the problema and solution and then converts it into an Mkdocs website hosted on GitHub Pages.

### If you want to use this project
If you want to use this project follow the steps [here](https://github.com/NinePiece2/Leetcode-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-steps).

### Steps
1. Uses the ```joshcai/leetcode-sync``` GitHub action to will the problems and solutions from leetcode into the ```/Solutions``` folder.
2. Uses the Script ```update_project_readme.py``` to compile all of the completed problems into a table in 2 readme files that can be used for GitHub and the Mkdocs site
3. Uses the Script ```update_readmes.py.py``` to create README files from the problems and solutions and embed their difficulty, tags and the solution's statistics.
4. Uses Mkdocs to convert the READMEs created in `Step 3` to a website.
5. The website is then deployed using the GitHub Pages deploy action.
